# MyWebsiteNode
Turning my static website into a dynamic website using Node and Express.

This was an experiment to see how easily my static website could be turned into a dynamic website.

The next step might be to add an email signup page so that people interested could be added to a MailChimp email list.

The website is deployed here:
