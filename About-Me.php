  I am an immigrant to Canada; I came here almost 20 years ago and became a citizen. I went to school at the University of Toronto and graduated from their Electrical Engineering program. I enjoy working on my websites, watching tv and movies, reading books and graphic novels, listening to music and playing the piano.
  <br />
  <br />
  I believe that it is important to never give up and that everything ends when you stop believing in the value of what you offer to the world as well as what it offers to you. In that case, I will never stop striving to make the most of what I have in life.";
